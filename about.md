When I was in high school, I realized that I loved programming. I spent most of my summer vacations writing code for various websites. After high school I decided to make a career out of it. I have been developing software professionally for almost 12 years and still enjoy it. I currently write web applications using a variety of technologies for both small and large companies.

I am a husband and father of [twin](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-momo-twins-20120324,0,7096332.story) [boys](http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-momo-twins-first-trip-20120419,0,1093541.story) [that](http://perryhall.patch.com/articles/rare-momo-babies-born-to-perry-hall-parents) were born in 2012 and a daughter born in 2016.
